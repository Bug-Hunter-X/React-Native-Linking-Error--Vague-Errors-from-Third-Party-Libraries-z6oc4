The solution involves carefully reviewing the third-party library's integration instructions.  This includes verifying that the required native modules are properly linked.  For iOS, this usually involves checking the Xcode project's configuration and ensuring that the necessary frameworks and libraries are included.  For Android, you might need to confirm the correct setup in `android/app/build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`.  Below is an example, assuming a library named `react-native-mylibrary`:

**Incorrect (Causes the Error):**
```javascript
//ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js
import MyLibraryComponent from 'react-native-mylibrary';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <MyLibraryComponent someProp="value" />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Correct (Solution):**
```javascript
//ThirdPartyLibraryBugSolution.js
import MyLibraryComponent from 'react-native-mylibrary'; // Make sure this import is correct and the library is installed correctly

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <MyLibraryComponent someProp="value" />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Additional Steps:**

* Clean and rebuild the project.
* Check the library's documentation for specific linking instructions for your platform (iOS and/or Android).
* Verify that the library is compatible with your current React Native version.
* Check for any specific build errors that might offer clues regarding the linking issue.
* Double-check your package.json and make sure the library is listed and that you've run the link command (if required) for the library.

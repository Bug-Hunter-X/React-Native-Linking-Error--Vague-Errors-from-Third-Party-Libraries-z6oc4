This error occurs when you are using a third-party library in your React Native project that has not been properly linked or configured.  This can manifest in various ways, such as the app crashing, unexpected behavior, or build failures.  The symptoms are often vague and may not directly point to the linking issue.  For example, you might see a generic error like 'undefined is not an object' evaluating a property on a component, without any clear indication that a library is involved.

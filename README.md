# React Native Linking Error: Vague Errors from Third-Party Libraries

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving third-party libraries.  The problem arises when a library isn't correctly linked, leading to confusing, generic error messages that don't directly indicate the root cause.

## The Problem

The main challenge is the lack of specific error messages. Instead of a clear error pointing towards the linking issue, you might see a generic error such as `undefined is not an object` when trying to access a property of a component from a third-party library.  Debugging becomes significantly harder without a clear indication that the issue is related to the library linking process. 

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on meticulous library linking, ensuring correct integration with the React Native project.  It involves verifying the steps outlined in the library's documentation and addressing any inconsistencies.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Attempt to run the application. You will encounter vague errors. 
5. Refer to the `ThirdPartyLibraryBugSolution.js` file to see the corrected implementation and linking steps.
